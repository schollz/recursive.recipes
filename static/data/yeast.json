    "Crush the grapes using a potato masher or your hands to release their juice.",
    "Cover the container with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it sit for several days.",
    "During this time, natural yeast present on the grape skins will ferment the juice.",
    "After several days, strain the liquid from the grape pulp.",
    "Transfer the liquid to a sterile glass jar or container.",
    "Cover the jar loosely with a clean cloth or coffee filter to allow for airflow.",
    "Let the liquid sit at room temperature for 1-2 weeks, stirring occasionally.",
    "Over time, the yeast will multiply and consume the sugars in the liquid, producing carbon dioxide and alcohol.",
    "Once the liquid has developed a yeasty aroma and a layer of foam on top, it is ready to use as yeast.",
    "To use the yeast in recipes, measure out the desired amount and add it to the dough or batter as directed.",
    "Store any remaining yeast in the refrigerator for future use."
