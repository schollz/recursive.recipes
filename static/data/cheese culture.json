    "Heat the milk in a large pot until it reaches 90\u00b0F (32\u00b0C).",
    "Sprinkle the cheese starter culture over the surface of the milk and let it sit undisturbed for 1-2 minutes.",
    "Gently stir the culture into the milk using a spoon.",
    "Cover the pot with a clean cloth and let it sit at room temperature for 12-24 hours, or until the milk has thickened and coagulated.",
    "Cut the coagulated milk into curds using a long knife or curd cutter.",
    "Gently stir the curds for 15 minutes to release more whey.",
    "Line a colander with cheesecloth and carefully transfer the curds into it, allowing any remaining whey to drain through.",
    "Tie the corners of the cheesecloth together and hang it up to drain for 6-8 hours, or until the desired consistency is reached.",
    "Remove the cheese from the cheesecloth, shape it into a ball or a block, and place it in a container for aging.",
    "Store the cheese at the appropriate temperature and humidity for the specific type of cheese culture being used.",
    "Allow the cheese to age for the recommended time, typically ranging from a few days to several months, depending on the desired flavor and texture."
